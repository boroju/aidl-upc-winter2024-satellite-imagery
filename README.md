# ðŸ”¥ Wildfire Segmentation Project - UPC Master in Artificial Intelligence with Deep Learning

## Introduction
Welcome to our GitHub repository for the Wildfire Segmentation Project, developed as the capstone project for the Postgraduate Program in Artificial Intelligence with Deep Learning. This project is aimed at leveraging the power of deep learning to address the critical and increasingly prevalent issue of wildfires. By employing semantic segmentation techniques on satellite images, we aim to accurately identify and predict wildfire-affected areas, contributing to better management, response, and mitigation strategies.

## Project Objective
The primary objective of this project is to apply semantic segmentation to satellite imagery for the precise identification of areas affected by wildfires. Utilizing state-of-the-art deep learning techniques, we aim to develop a model capable of distinguishing between burned and unburned areas, thereby facilitating more effective wildfire monitoring and management. The project underscores the importance of advanced AI in environmental protection and disaster response efforts.


## Dataset Overview
Our unique dataset is crafted using images from the National Agriculture Imagery Program (NAIP) and the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) Fire and Thermal Anomalies datasets, accessed through Google Earth Engine (GEE). Specifically, the dataset includes:

- **NAIP Imagery:** High-resolution aerial imagery from NAIP, crucial for detailed landscape features. The NAIP dataset can be accessed [here](https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/datasets/catalog/USDA_NAIP_DOQQ).
- **MODIS Thermal Anomalies and Fire Data:** Essential data for identifying wildfire occurrences, sourced from the MODIS dataset. This dataset can be found [here](https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/datasets/catalog/MODIS_061_MOD14A1).

### Manual Annotation

For the accurate identification of burned and not burned areas corresponding to the wildfires in Paradise, California, and Cameron Peak, Colorado, we performed manual annotations. By visually inspecting the BurnDate mask provided by MODIS within GEE, we systematically marked areas affected by the fires. This meticulous process resulted in a precise dataset consisting of images and corresponding masks for training our model, with a total of 145 burned areas and 182 not burned areas annotated. This step was crucial for ensuring the high quality and reliability of our training dataset, directly impacting the model's ability to accurately segment satellite imagery based on the presence of wildfires.

### Data Processing and Preparation
The creation of our dataset involved several key steps:
- **Data Acquisition:** Programmatic access and download of high-resolution NAIP imagery and MODIS thermal anomalies data from GEE.
- **Preprocessing:** Alignment and scaling of NAIP and MODIS data to ensure that each NAIP image was ![perfectly matched](https://code.earthengine.google.com/9e8459b1f855f28f6dd91c3afa1d17fb?hideCode=true) with its corresponding MODIS mask based on geographic location and projection.
- **Augmentation and Splitting:** The dataset was augmented and randomly split into training, validation, and testing sets to ensure robust model training and evaluation.

Crucially, these images, depicting landcover, NDVI, and NDWI, serve as the foundational dataset feeding into the segmentation algorithm. Each piece of information captured in these images contributes to training the model to distinguish and identify specific features, enabling precise semantic segmentation for wildfire prediction.

**NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index):** NDVI is a vegetation index commonly derived from satellite imagery. It quantifies the presence and health of vegetation by comparing the reflectance of near-infrared light to that of red light. Higher NDVI values typically indicate healthier and more abundant vegetation.

**NDWI (Normalized Difference Water Index):** NDWI is another spectral index, but it focuses on water content. It is derived by comparing the reflectance of green and near-infrared light. Higher NDWI values suggest the presence of water, aiding in the identification of water bodies.

**Role in Algorithm:** Including NDVI and NDWI data in the segmentation algorithm is crucial. NDVI helps in delineating vegetation, enabling the model to discern areas susceptible to wildfires. On the other hand, NDWI assists in identifying water bodies, aiding in a more comprehensive understanding of the landscape. Together, these indices enhance the algorithm's ability to accurately segment satellite imagery, contributing to effective wildfire prediction and management.

## Model Training with PyTorch
Our model is based on a transfer learning approach using DeepLabv3 with a ResNet50 backbone, pre-trained on a relevant dataset to kickstart the learning process. We further customized the model to accept inputs with additional channels (RGB, NDVI, and NDWI features) and output two layers representing the probabilities assigned to each pixel for being part of a burned or unburned area.

### Initial Model Training Details

- **Environment:** Training was conducted on Google Colab Pro with GPU acceleration and high-memory VMs to handle the computational demands.
- **Monitoring and Experimentation:** We utilized TensorBoard for real-time monitoring of training metrics and experimented with various configurations using Weights & Biases (W&B).
- **Loss Function:** The model employs Focal Loss to address the class imbalance issue inherent in our dataset, focusing on harder-to-classify examples for improved performance.
- **Early Stopping:** To prevent overfitting, we implemented an EarlyStopping mechanism based on validation loss.
